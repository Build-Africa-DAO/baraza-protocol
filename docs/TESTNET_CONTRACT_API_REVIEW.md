# Baraza Testnet Contract and API Review

Date: 2026-05-26

This review covers the current Solana and Stellar surfaces needed for a testnet push. It is intentionally practical: what exists, what is deployable, which APIs are exposed, and what must be configured before reviewers test live payments and governance.

## Executive Readiness

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Solana Anchor contracts | Ready to build, not yet configured for devnet deploy | Five programs exist and compile through `cargo test --workspace`. `Anchor.toml` still points at `localnet`. |
| Solana CLI/deploy path | Blocked on local CLI | `anchor-cli 0.30.1` is installed, but `solana` CLI is not available in PATH on this machine. |
| Stellar contracts | Not present | The repo has Stellar Horizon payment verification/client helpers, but no Soroban contract workspace or WASM artifact. |
| Stellar testnet verification | Ready for API testing | `/api/stellar/verify-payment` verifies native XLM payment transactions through Horizon testnet. |
| Server persistence | Depends on env vars | API routes write to Supabase only when `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set. |

## Contract Review Findings

### Blockers Before Production Treasury Movement

1. Treasury withdrawals are still admin-gated, not proposal-gated.
   - File: `programs/treasury_vault/src/lib.rs`
   - The header says withdrawals require an executed governance proposal, but `release_sol` currently checks `withdrawals_enabled` plus `admin` signer. The proposal account is unchecked until the TODO CPI validation is implemented.
   - Testnet recommendation: keep `withdrawals_enabled = false` for public review. Allow deposits and balances only.

2. Governance execution does not dispatch proposal effects yet.
   - File: `programs/governance/src/lib.rs`
   - `execute_proposal` transitions proposals to `Executed` but the CPI dispatch into treasury, membership, or rule changes is still TODO.
   - Testnet recommendation: label execution as a governance signal until CPI is implemented.

3. Membership activation depends on payment attestation, but the off-chain-to-on-chain attestation path is not wired end to end.
   - File: `programs/membership/src/lib.rs`
   - `activate_member` validates a consumed `PaymentAttestationAccount`, but the API routes currently write Supabase membership/order rows rather than submitting Anchor instructions.
   - Testnet recommendation: treat Supabase membership as the app source for review, and schedule on-chain attestation wiring as the next contract task.

4. Community member count is admin-maintained.
   - File: `programs/community_registry/src/lib.rs`
   - `bump_member_count` has a TODO to restrict the caller to the membership program by CPI. Current placeholder is admin-only.
   - Testnet recommendation: do not use this count as a hard security gate.

5. Stellar Soroban contract is missing.
   - Searched repo for Soroban/contract artifacts; only SDK dependencies were found under `node_modules`.
   - Testnet recommendation: push Stellar payment verification first. Create a Soroban contract workspace only when Stellar-native governance/treasury state is required.

### Moderate Risks

1. SPL deposits are event-only.
   - File: `programs/treasury_vault/src/lib.rs`
   - `record_spl_deposit` emits an event and increments counters but does not verify token balance movement.

2. Governance snapshot inputs are admin-provided.
   - File: `programs/governance/src/lib.rs`
   - `activate_proposal` accepts `total_eligible_weight` and `total_eligible_members` from the admin. Future CPI should read this from membership state.

3. Public frontend has fallback program IDs.
   - File: `app/src/lib/programs/pda.ts`
   - This is useful for demos, but deployed testnet should explicitly set all program IDs in Vercel after deploy.

## Solana Devnet Push Plan

1. Install Solana CLI locally and confirm `solana --version`.
2. Fund the deployer on devnet:
   ```powershell
   solana config set --url devnet
   solana airdrop 5 <DEPLOYER_PUBKEY>
   ```
3. Build the Anchor workspace:
   ```powershell
   anchor build
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
4. Deploy to devnet:
   ```powershell
   anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
   ```
5. Save deployed program IDs in Vercel:
   - `VITE_COMMUNITY_REGISTRY_PROGRAM_ID`
   - `VITE_GOVERNANCE_PROGRAM_ID`
   - `VITE_MEMBERSHIP_PROGRAM_ID`
   - `VITE_PAYMENT_ATTESTATION_PROGRAM_ID`
   - `VITE_TREASURY_VAULT_PROGRAM_ID`
6. Seed one review community on devnet:
   - Create community
   - Create membership tier
   - Initialize governance config
   - Initialize treasury vault
   - Keep treasury withdrawals disabled
7. Run reviewer smoke:
   - Connect Phantom on Solana devnet
   - Browse group
   - Join group through demo payment path
   - Create proposal
   - Cast vote
   - Deposit SOL into treasury vault
   - Confirm program accounts on Solana Explorer devnet

## Stellar Testnet Push Plan

1. Create/fund a Stellar testnet treasury account with Friendbot.
2. Set:
   - `STELLAR_TREASURY_ACCOUNT`
   - `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
   - `VITE_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
3. Send a small native XLM payment to the treasury account with a real Stellar testnet account.
4. Verify it through:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
     -Uri https://baraza-protocol.vercel.app/api/stellar/verify-payment `
     -ContentType application/json `
     -Body '{"communityId":"ky","txHash":"<64-char-hash>","amountXlm":1}'
   ```
5. Confirm response includes:
   - `status: PAYMENT_CONFIRMED`
   - `rail: stellar`
   - `ledger`
   - `persisted: true` when Supabase env is configured
6. Only after this should a Soroban contract be added for Stellar-native governance/treasury execution.

## Verification Completed Locally

```text
anchor-cli 0.30.1
cargo test --workspace: passed
Vitest Stellar suite: 3 files passed, 20 tests passed
solana CLI: missing from PATH
stellar CLI: missing from PATH
```

`cargo test --workspace` emits Anchor/Solana macro `unexpected cfg` warnings from Anchor 0.30.1 dependencies. These are warnings, not test failures, but should be triaged before strict CI is enabled.

## Next Contract Tasks

1. Add Solana CLI to the deploy environment and run `anchor build`.
2. Change testnet deployment config from `localnet` to `devnet` or always deploy with `--provider.cluster devnet`.
3. Deploy the five Solana programs and update Vercel program ID env vars.
4. Add a seed script for community, tier, governance config, and vault initialization.
5. Wire Supabase payment orders to `payment_attestation::attest_payment`, `consume_payment_for_mint`, and `membership::activate_member`.
6. Implement governance CPI dispatch for treasury releases before enabling withdrawals.
7. Decide whether Stellar needs only payment verification or a Soroban governance contract. If Soroban is needed, scaffold it as a separate contract workspace and add build/deploy docs.
