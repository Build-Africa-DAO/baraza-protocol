### Stellar

## 4. Cross-chain wiring

- [ ] Message delivery failure fallback logic implemented
- [ ] HIGH RISK: Stellar bridge support explicitly confirmed with LayerZero / Wormhole before relying on it

## 5. Chainlink oracle integration

- [ ] Fallback behavior defined if oracle returns stale or invalid data

- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured, for example OpenZeppelin Defender or Tenderly on EVM chains
- [ ] Incident response runbook updated with new addresses

## 7. Promote decision

Before promoting to mainnet, confirm:

- [ ] Testnet deployment passed all checks above
- [ ] Internal review signed off
- [ ] HIGH RISK: External audit completed and all critical / high findings remediated
- [ ] HIGH RISK: Bug bounty program live before mainnet governance is active
- [ ] Cross-chain message round-trip tested with real bridge on testnet
- [ ] Multisig signers tested signing and executing a real proposal
- [ ] Emergency pause / kill switch tested and documented
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and reviewed

## Deployment readiness verdict

**NOT READY - audit not started; remaining Solana negative-path integration tests not yet written; Stellar oracle and bridge support unconfirmed; Gnosis Safe replacement on Solana and Stellar not yet decided.**
