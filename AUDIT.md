## 3. What Is Working

- React/Vite SPA routing for home, explore, bounties, evaluate, launch, profile, dashboard, treasury, proposal details, join flow, admin, and 404.
- Header, mobile nav, chain selector, theme toggle, search, and Asha chat UI.
- Supabase client fallback pattern: when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are missing, communities and bounties use mock/localStorage data.
- Community list, community detail/dashboard, creation form, and local/Supabase community persistence.
- Bounty list with board/grid/list views, status filters, detail page, local/Supabase bounty creation, local/Supabase submissions, and member-gated bounty posting.
- Local membership activation record through `localStorage`.
- Payment order polling endpoint and membership activation endpoint backed by Supabase service role when configured.
- M-Pesa simulator endpoint for sandbox/demo payment orders.
- Stellar Horizon transaction verification endpoint for native XLM payment hashes.
- Stellar SDK helpers for balances, tx confirmation, testnet XLM payment submission, local linked accounts, and local settlement records.
- Solana wallet adapter provider with Phantom, Solflare, and Coinbase adapter packages.
- Stellar Freighter-style browser connection attempt in `WalletStatus`.
- Lightweight injected EVM account connection and testnet switching through `window.ethereum`.
- EVM read client for token supply, governor proposal count, treasury balance, and member token balance using raw JSON-RPC.
- Asha chat is live as a deterministic local response bot.
- Asha security review layer is implemented as deterministic rule checks for communities, proposals, and bounties.
- Admin dashboard route exists and is gated by `VITE_ADMIN_WALLETS`.
- Five Solana Anchor programs exist and compile through `cargo test --workspace`.
- EVM Solidity contract package exists with Manager, Token, Auction, Governor, Treasury, metadata, minter, and tests.
- TypeScript check passed: `npm --prefix app run typecheck`.
- ESLint passed: `npm --prefix app run lint`.
- Previous local contract verification: `cargo test --workspace` passed, with Anchor macro warnings.

## 4. What Is In The UI But Not Built

- Solana write actions are preview-blocked: `useBarazaContract` returns toasts instead of submitting real transactions for join, create community, and vote.
- Bounty payout approval is visual/local only; there is no escrow, payout transaction, owner approval endpoint, or on-chain reward movement.
- Admin reconciliation tables use hardcoded payment orders and mint jobs.
- Admin actions like export, sync, refund approval, retry mint, and reconciliation are preview toasts.
- Asha "AI" is local keyword matching and deterministic safety rules, not a model/API-backed AI security layer.
- Phone/email onboarding stores a local identity session only; no MPC wallet, OTP provider, or account recovery.
- M-Pesa real Daraja/Africa's Talking STK Push/callback is not implemented; only simulator exists.
- Stellar treasury/payout/off-ramp is not implemented; only payment verification exists.
- Chain selector lists many chains with metadata, but only Solana, Stellar payment verification, and EVM read/switch behavior have code behind them.
- Testnet metadata is shown, but Solana programs are not deployed/configured to devnet in this repo state.
- Community health/admin metrics are mostly mock/local computed values, not indexed chain metrics.
- "Create community token", grant eligibility, umbrella treasury, dividends, and mass payouts are not implemented.
- Proposal comments/chat and full audit trail UI are not implemented.

## 5. What Is Completely Missing

- GoodDollar SDK integration.
- GoodDollar Identity contract integration.
- G$ reward token selection and transfer/payout logic.
- Celo-specific GoodDollar bounty rewards.
- XDC integration.
- NEAR, Algorand, Hedera, Tron, Aptos, Sui, Flow, and Chainlink integrations.
- Chain adapter abstraction that routes all actions away from UI components.
- The Graph indexing layer.
- IPFS/Filecoin storage integration.
- Privy or Web3Auth MPC wallet creation and recovery.
- WhatsApp, SMS, Telegram, Discord, and email notification services.
- Real bounty escrow, payout trigger, and dispute resolution.
- Community SPL token minting and optional launch flow.
- Umbrella token, shared liquidity pool, grant circuit breaker, and grant distribution.
- Real-world asset tracking and member return/dividend distribution.
- NFT threshold gate for admin access.
- Soroban/Stellar contract workspace.
- Solana devnet deployment scripts/seed scripts.

## 6. Chain Connections

| Chain | Real or placeholder? | Wallet/account path | Actions supported | Missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solana | Partial real | Phantom/Solflare/Coinbase wallet adapter | Connect account, read attempted treasury/proposal accounts, Anchor IDLs/program clients exist | Devnet deployment, real write txs, SPL mint, membership mint, payment attestation wiring, governance CPI |
| Stellar | Partial real | Freighter-style browser API and local linked account | Horizon tx verification, balance helper, tx confirmation, testnet XLM payment helper | Soroban contracts, treasury state, payouts, M-Pesa on/off ramp, SDP/SEP flows |
| Ethereum | Partial read | Injected EVM wallet | Switch/connect and raw RPC reads for configured contract addresses | Wagmi/viem signing, app-specific deployed testnet validation, membership flow |
| Base | Partial read | Injected EVM wallet / Coinbase suggested | Switch/connect and raw RPC reads for configured contract addresses | Full onboarding flow, writes, real community mapping |
| Arbitrum | Partial read | Injected EVM wallet / Rabby suggested | Switch/connect and raw RPC reads if address config exists | Writes, DeFi community workflows |
| Optimism | Partial read | Injected EVM wallet / MetaMask suggested | Switch/connect and raw RPC reads if address config exists | Writes, public goods DAO workflows |
| Polygon | UI metadata mostly | Injected EVM wallet | Chain metadata and switch target | Token minting flow, app contracts |
| BNB Chain | Disabled placeholder | Trust Wallet suggested | Chain metadata only | Full integration |
| Celo | Partial metadata/read path | Valora/MetaMask suggested | Chain metadata, switch target, public RPC path | GoodDollar/G$ rewards and identity |
| XDC | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| NEAR | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Algorand | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Hedera | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Tron | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Aptos/Sui | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Flow | Missing | None | None | Full integration |
| Chainlink | Missing | None | None | CCIP, price feeds, oracle integrations |

Testnet availability status:

- Solana devnet is configured as the default network in env examples and UI metadata, but deployment is blocked locally because the `solana` CLI is missing.
- Stellar testnet Horizon is configured and usable through `/api/stellar/verify-payment`.
- EVM testnet metadata exists for Sepolia/Base Sepolia/Arbitrum Sepolia/OP Sepolia/Polygon Amoy/BNB testnet/Celo Alfajores, but write flows are not implemented.

## 7. Smart Contracts

### Solana

Anchor programs:

- `community_registry`
- `governance`
- `membership`
- `payment_attestation`
- `treasury_vault`

Frontend Solana client files:

- `app/src/lib/programs/client.ts`
- `app/src/lib/programs/pda.ts`
- `app/src/lib/programs/idl/*.ts`
- `app/src/hooks/useBarazaContract.ts`

Status:

- Program code exists.
- Program IDs are hardcoded fallbacks and env-overridable.
- `Anchor.toml` is still `localnet`.
- Reads are attempted through Anchor clients.
- Writes are intentionally blocked in preview mode.
- No confirmed devnet deployment from this machine.

### EVM

Contracts:

- `contracts/evm/src/manager/Manager.sol`
- `contracts/evm/src/token/Token.sol`
- `contracts/evm/src/auction/Auction.sol`
- `contracts/evm/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol`
- `contracts/evm/src/governance/treasury/Treasury.sol`
- plus proxy, metadata, minter, escrow, and utility contracts.

Frontend EVM client:

- `app/src/lib/programs/evmClient.ts`
- `app/src/lib/programs/evmAddresses.ts`
- `app/src/lib/evm/abis.ts`

Status:

- Raw JSON-RPC read calls exist.
- Address files exist for several EVM chain IDs.
- No frontend EVM write/signing flow exists.

### Stellar

Status:

- No Soroban contract exists.
- Stellar implementation is SDK/Horizon payment verification only.

## 8. Type Safety

Checks run:

- `npm --prefix app run typecheck`: passed, no TypeScript errors.
- `npm --prefix app run lint`: passed.

Findings:

- No `as any` usage found in app source.
- IDL files use `as unknown as <IDLType>` casts.
- `app/src/polyfill.ts` uses `globalThis as unknown as GlobalShim`.
- `EthereumProvider.request` returns `Promise<unknown>` and event payloads are typed as `unknown`, which is acceptable for external provider boundaries but should be wrapped before a larger chain adapter rollout.
- Some hook dependency lint suppressions exist in `AshaChat.tsx`, `JoinDao.tsx`, `LiveStatCard.tsx`, and `useBarazaData.ts`.

## 9. Dependencies Needed

Needed for the requested buildathon scope and not currently installed in `app/package.json`:

- `ethers`
- `wagmi`
- `viem`
- `@wagmi/core`
- `@gooddollar/goodprotocol`
- `@solana/spl-token`
- `@privy-io/react-auth`
- `@walletconnect/modal`
- `@apollo/client`
- `graphql`
- `ipfs-http-client`
- `twilio`
- `@sendgrid/mail`
- `bignumber.js`
- `date-fns`
- `zustand`

Already present:

- `@solana/web3.js`
- `@coral-xyz/anchor`
- `@stellar/stellar-sdk`

Potentially needed but not listed in the prompt:

- `@tanstack/react-query` if wagmi v2 patterns are used.
- A maintained IPFS alternative if `ipfs-http-client` compatibility is a concern.

## 10. Risk Flags

- `main` must remain untouched; current branch is correct.
- Uncommitted baseline changes existed before the audit branch was created; they are now committed on `feat/gooddollar-buildathon`.
- Solana CLI missing, so Solana devnet push cannot be completed locally yet.
- Stellar CLI missing, so Soroban/testnet contract deploy cannot be completed locally.
- Solana programs are not confirmed deployed to devnet; `Anchor.toml` uses `localnet`.
- Treasury withdrawals are admin-gated in contract code and must remain disabled until governance CPI is implemented.
- Governance execution marks proposals executed but does not dispatch side effects.
- Payment attestation is not wired from API to on-chain membership activation.
- M-Pesa simulator can create confirmed payment orders; real provider callbacks are missing.
- Supabase service role key is required for durable server-side writes.
- Admin dashboard is gated by public env allowlist only; no backend session/auth guard.
- `VITE_ADMIN_WALLETS` is public by design and cannot be treated as a secret.
- Public RPC endpoints may rate-limit or be unreliable for review.
- EVM address constants appear reused across chains and need verification against intended Baraza deployments.
- DataStore simulates live members/votes/funds with timers, so some UI metrics are not real.
- Sensitive server envs must stay server-only and never use `VITE_`.

## Phase 1 Summary

The current app is a strong review prototype with real UI coverage, Supabase/local persistence, deterministic Asha review rules, Stellar Horizon payment verification, Solana Anchor program scaffolding, and EVM read scaffolding. It is not yet a full GoodDollar/buildathon implementation. The largest missing foundations are the chain adapter, GoodDollar/Celo integration, MPC onboarding, notification services, IPFS/The Graph, payout systems, community/umbrella token logic, and real on-chain write execution.

Testnet must be available for the sprint. The repo is closest on Stellar testnet verification and Solana devnet readiness, but Solana devnet deployment requires installing the Solana CLI, deploying the five programs, updating Vercel env program IDs, and seeding test data.
