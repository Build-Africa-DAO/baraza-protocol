# Baraza Protocol — AI Agent Instructions

## What this repo is

Baraza is a community finance and governance protocol for African groups. Communities pool funds in **Stellar treasury accounts**, pay membership dues in XLM or KES via M-Pesa, and govern shared resources through on-chain proposals and votes. The native token is **BRZA** — a Stellar custom asset.

**Layer summary:**
- **Stellar** — primary settlement layer. All treasuries are Stellar G-accounts. BRZA is a Stellar custom asset. All payment rails (M-Pesa, XLM direct) settle to a community Stellar treasury address.
- **Solana** — governance layer. Five Anchor programs handle community registry, membership tiers, proposals, votes, payment attestation, and treasury vault logic.
- **EVM** — secondary governance token (ERC-721) on Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Celo, Sepolia. Read-only for now.
- **Supabase** — off-chain persistence for payment orders, memberships, and admin state. Always optional — every route falls back gracefully when env vars are absent.

---

## BRZA Token

- **Type:** Stellar custom asset
- **Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (1B), 7 decimals
- **Phase-0 price:** $0.02
- **Issuer:** `VITE_BRZA_ISSUER_ADDRESS` (Stellar G-account)
- **Distributor:** `VITE_BRZA_DISTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS` (Stellar G-account)
- **Config:** `app/src/lib/brza/constants.ts` — all values are `as const`, never mutate at runtime
- **Treasury reader:** `app/src/lib/brza/treasury.ts`
- **TVL reader:** `app/src/lib/brza/tvl.ts`

BRZA is separate from supported payment rails. Do not conflate "paying in BRZA" with "paying via Stellar XLM."

## Payment Flow (source of truth)

### Stellar XLM path

```
Client calls POST /api/stellar/create-payment-intent
  -> Server signs HMAC intent token (communityId + amountXlm + expiresAt) using STELLAR_INTENT_SECRET
  -> Returns intentToken to client

User sends XLM on Stellar network

Client calls POST /api/stellar/verify-payment { txHash, intentToken, environment }
  -> Server verifies HMAC token (required on mainnet; legacy fields allowed on testnet only)
  -> Fetches tx from Horizon, checks: successful, native payment, amount >= expected, to == treasury
  -> Writes payment_orders row (status: PAYMENT_CONFIRMED, provider: stellar)
  -> Returns { orderId, activationSecret, status: PAYMENT_CONFIRMED }

Cron /api/cron/promote-orders advances: PAYMENT_CONFIRMED → MINT_QUEUED → MINT_SUBMITTED
  → MINT_CONFIRMED → INDEXER_CONFIRMED → RECONCILED (one step per minute, demo mode)

Client polls /api/payment-orders/status until INDEXER_CONFIRMED or RECONCILED

Client calls POST /api/membership/activate { orderId, communityId, walletAddress, activationSecret }
  -> Server verifies: order exists, status ∈ {INDEXER_CONFIRMED, RECONCILED},
     activationSecret hash matches, walletAddress not bound to another order
  -> Writes memberships row (status: ACTIVE)
  -> Returns { ok: true, memberId }
```

### M-Pesa (Kotani Pay KES→XLM onramp) path

```
Trusted server-to-server call: POST /api/payments/brza-membership
  (requires Authorization: Bearer PAYMENT_ADAPTER_PROXY_SECRET)
  { phone, communityId, communityCode, communityTreasuryAddress, amountKes, idempotencyKey }
  -> Idempotency check (no double-charge)
  -> Writes payment_orders row (status: CREATED, provider: kotani)
  -> Calls Kotani POST /v1/onramp/stellar — KES → XLM to communityTreasuryAddress
  -> Updates order: status PAYMENT_PENDING, provider_reference = Kotani reference
  -> Returns { orderId, activationSecret, providerReference, status: PAYMENT_PENDING }

Polling: POST /api/payments/reconcile-brza-membership { orderId }
  -> Fetches Kotani GET /v1/status/:reference
  -> Maps Kotani status → internal status (completed → PAYMENT_CONFIRMED, failed/expired → terminal)
  -> Patches payment_orders row
  -> Returns { orderId, status, changed }

After PAYMENT_CONFIRMED, same cron promoter and membership/activate as Stellar path above.
```

### Payment order status machine

```
CREATED → PAYMENT_PENDING → PAYMENT_CONFIRMED → MINT_QUEUED → MINT_SUBMITTED
  → MINT_CONFIRMED → INDEXER_CONFIRMED → RECONCILED   ← activation fires here or at INDEXER_CONFIRMED

Terminal failure states: PAYMENT_FAILED, PAYMENT_EXPIRED, AMOUNT_MISMATCH
```

**Cron promoter (`/api/cron/promote-orders`) is a demo step-counter.** Production must replace it with real BRZA mint + Stellar indexer confirmation before the INDEXER_CONFIRMED gate.

## Architecture Rules

- **All business logic lives in `app/src/lib/`** — components call hooks; hooks call lib functions. Never import lib directly in components.
- **Chain adapters are the single entry point** for all chain interactions. Do not call Solana/Stellar/EVM SDKs directly from hooks or components.
- **Wallet support is restricted to Phantom, Solflare, and Coinbase Wallet** via `BarazaWalletModalProvider`. Do not add other wallets.
- **`app/src/lib/knowledgeGraph.ts`** must be updated whenever a new chain rail, contract address, settlement route, or testnet readiness task is added.
- **BRZA config** is `as const` in `app/src/lib/brza/constants.ts`. Do not mutate at runtime.
- **Supabase is optional everywhere.** Every API route must work without Supabase env vars (fall back to local state gracefully).
- **No fallback program IDs in production.** `app/src/lib/programs/pda.ts` uses `PLACEHOLDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` as a dev fallback — replace with real Vercel env vars before production.
- **intentToken is required for Stellar mainnet.** Legacy `communityId` + `amountXlm` fields in `verify-payment` are testnet-only. Do not relax this gate.
- **Activation secret must be kept client-side** from the moment the payment order is created until membership activation. It is never re-exposed by the server.
- **Chain names must NOT appear in UI** except on the onboarding screen and withdrawal screen. Everywhere else users see KES balance, a pay button, and a vote button — never "Stellar", "Solana", "Base", or any other chain name.
- **GOODDOLLAR_ENABLED must remain false** in all committed code. GoodDollar/Celo is a scaffold for later. Do not set it to true or make it configurable from the frontend.
- **`/lib/adapters/index.ts` is the only permitted entry point** for chain interactions. No component, hook, or API route may import Stellar SDK, Solana web3.js, or viem directly — always through the adapter layer.
- **Loan terms are hardcoded** — 50% LTV, 5% APR, 12-month term. These values are in `app/src/lib/brza/constants.ts` (`LOAN_TERMS`) and must never be made configurable or overridden.

## Testnet Status

| Chain | Status | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Stellar | testnet-ready | Fund treasury G-account, set `STELLAR_TREASURY_ACCOUNT` |
| Solana | partial | `solana` CLI missing from PATH; Anchor.toml targets localnet |
| Celo/GoodDollar | coming-soon | Need Alfajores token/identity addresses |
| EVM | partial | All contract addresses are placeholders |

---

## Hard Production Blockers

Do not enable treasury withdrawals or move to mainnet until these are done:

1. **Cron promoter** (`/api/cron/promote-orders`) is a demo step-counter — replace with real BRZA mint + Stellar indexer confirmation. Without this, `INDEXER_CONFIRMED` never fires on real payments.
2. **Governance → treasury CPI** (`programs/governance/src/lib.rs`) — rule changes and membership actions are wired but TODO. Must be completed and tested before treasury release is enabled.
3. **Treasury vault release authority** (`programs/treasury_vault/src/lib.rs`) — hand release authority to a Squads vault PDA and test on devnet before setting `withdrawals_enabled = true`.
4. **`user_id_hash` in membership activate** — currently stores `wallet:<address>` as a placeholder. Production must replace with the HMAC-peppered phone hash from auth.
5. **Solana `payment_attestation::attest_payment`** — Supabase payment orders are not yet wired to the on-chain attestation program. Wire this before treating on-chain membership as canonical.
6. Run all Supabase migrations (`supabase/migrations/`) in filename order before any durable payment flow.

---

## Do Not

- Do not change the wallet adapter list (Phantom, Solflare, Coinbase only)
- Do not add Magic UI or other heavy animation libraries — removed deliberately
- Do not add features beyond what the current task requires
- Do not set `withdrawals_enabled = true` on the treasury vault until blockers above are cleared
- Do not commit real private keys, seed phrases, or service role secrets
- Do not import files from another repo with logic changes — copy verbatim
- Do not relax the intentToken requirement for Stellar mainnet payments
- Do not bypass the activation secret gate in `/api/membership/activate`
